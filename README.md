# Universal SQL Virtual Machine Microservice
This project provides SQL-like operations emulated across multiple backend adapters storages via different access interfaces.


### SQL Microservice: Project Summary

This project is a microservice designed to execute SQL-like operations across multiple backends, including traditional databases, Redis, Kafka, and blockchain platforms such as Hedera Hashgraph and Hyperledger Fabric. The service provides a unified interface for handling SQL queries and supports multiple access protocols, ensuring versatility and ease of integration.

### Key Features

1. Multi-Backend SQL Execution

The microservice routes SQL queries to different backends based on the adapter specified in the request. Supported backends include:

- Relational Databases (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL) using knex.
- Redis for key-value store emulation.
- Kafka for publish-subscribe messaging with SQL-like operations.
- Hedera Hashgraph for ledger-based SQL operations via smart contracts.
- Hyperledger Fabric for distributed ledger operations using chaincode.

2. Protocol Support
The service supports multiple communication protocols:

- REST API: Accessible via HTTP endpoints.
- gRPC: High-performance, secure communication with authentication via metadata.
- WebSockets: Real-time, bidirectional communication for SQL execution.
- MQTT: Lightweight messaging protocol for IoT and pub/sub applications.

3. Security
- JWT Authentication: Ensures secure access to all interfaces (REST, gRPC, WebSocket, MQTT).
- Input Validation: Validates SQL queries and adapter specifications to prevent injection attacks.
- Rate Limiting: Limits the number of requests per client to prevent abuse.
- Encryption: Option to use HTTPS/TLS for REST, gRPC, and WebSocket protocols.

4. SQL Parsing
- Uses node-sql-parser library for accurate parsing of SQL queries into structured Abstract Syntax Trees (AST).
- Supports SQL operations (depending on backend adapter used):
- SELECT
- INSERT
- UPDATE
- DELETE

5. Logging and Monitoring
- Centralized logging with Winston for tracking requests, responses, and errors.
- Separate log files for combined logs (combined.log) and errors (error.log).

6. Extensibility
- Modular architecture enables the addition of new adapters or backends with minimal effort.
- Easily extendable to support additional SQL operations or protocols.


### How It Works

- SQL Query Parsing:
SQL queries are parsed into AST using node-sql-parser.
Extracted details include operation type (e.g., SELECT), target table, columns, values, and conditions.

- Routing:
Based on the specified adapter, the query is routed to the appropriate backend (e.g., database, Redis, Kafka, blockchain).

- Execution:
Each backend has its adapter implementing standard CRUD-like operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
Response:

- The result is returned to the client in a consistent format.

### Use Cases
1. Distributed SQL Operations
    Perform SQL operations on traditional databases and distributed ledgers with a single interface.
2. Real-Time Applications
    Use WebSockets or MQTT for real-time SQL execution in applications like IoT or chat systems.
3. Blockchain Data Integration
    Integrate SQL queries with blockchain platforms like Hedera and Hyperledger Fabric for immutable, auditable data storage.
4. Caching with Redis
    Store and query frequently accessed data in Redis using SQL-like syntax.
5. Pub/Sub with Kafka
    Emulate SQL-like operations on Kafka topics for messaging-based workflows.
