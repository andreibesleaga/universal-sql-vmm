# Security Measures

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Universal SQL VMM project.

## Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT Authentication**: All API endpoints require a valid JWT token for authentication.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Users can be assigned different roles with varying levels of access.
- **Token Expiration**: JWTs have a configurable expiration time to limit the window of opportunity for token theft.

## Input Validation and Sanitization

- **SQL Validation**: All SQL queries are validated to ensure they meet the required format and structure.
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: SQL queries are checked for common SQL injection patterns.
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.
- **Parameter Validation**: Request parameters are validated for type, format, and allowed values.

## Rate Limiting and Throttling

- **API Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of requests per client to prevent abuse.
- **Authentication Rate Limiting**: More aggressive rate limiting for authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks.
- **Configurable Limits**: Rate limits can be configured based on endpoint sensitivity.

## Error Handling

- **Centralized Error Handling**: All errors are processed through a central error handler.
- **Sanitized Error Messages**: Error messages are sanitized to avoid leaking sensitive information.
- **Typed Errors**: Errors are categorized by type for better handling and reporting.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All errors are logged with context for debugging and auditing.

## Data Protection

- **Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted using AES-256-CBC.
- **Secure Headers**: HTTP headers are set to enhance security (using Helmet).
- **HTTPS Support**: All communications can be encrypted using HTTPS.
- **Payload Size Limits**: Request body size is limited to prevent DoS attacks.

## Secure Coding Practices

- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular scanning of dependencies for vulnerabilities.
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused code reviews for all changes.
- **Security Testing**: Automated security tests as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies are regularly updated to patch security vulnerabilities.

## Monitoring and Auditing

- **Request Logging**: All requests are logged for auditing purposes.
- **Error Monitoring**: Errors are monitored and alerted on.
- **Access Logging**: Authentication and authorization events are logged.
- **Performance Monitoring**: System performance is monitored to detect anomalies.

## Best Practices for Deployment

1. **Use Environment Variables**: Store sensitive configuration in environment variables.
2. **Implement Network Security**: Use firewalls and network segmentation.
3. **Regular Backups**: Implement regular backups of all data.
4. **Security Updates**: Keep the host system and all dependencies updated.
5. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Run the service with minimal required permissions.

## Security Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual security components.
- **Integration Tests**: Test security measures in combination.
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Load Testing**: Test the system under load to ensure security measures hold up.
